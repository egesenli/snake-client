# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

## Outcomes

This project was designed to teach about networking while giving the opportunity to review and use the knowledge of callbacks, asynchronous control flows, modules in node, writing modular code, refactoring code, and working with stdin. Through the context of building out a part of a game that runs in the terminal, a client can connect to a server using TCP. 

Finally, this project belongs to [Erkan Ege Senli](https://github.com/egesenli) and credit due to the original owner of the project is given below.

## How to play the game?

1) Run the client.js file with the **node play.js** command on your terminal.
2) Use the W, A, S, and D keys to be the up, left, down,
and right movements. Also, you can send some messages with the Q, E, F, X, and S keys.
3) Eat the red dots and avoid hitting the walls or eating your tail. Otherwise, our Snake server will politely notify you that the game is over :)
4) Press CTRL + C to quit the game.

The game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) may already be familiar to you, as it is one of the classics! The server code for this game was not written from scratch. It is a heavily modified version of the single player game Snek created by [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/).
